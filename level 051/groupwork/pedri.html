        Pedri comes from a modest background in the Canary Islands. He began playing football at a very young age and joined his local youth team, CD San Isidro, before moving to the UD Las Palmas academy, where he would rise through the ranks and show his extraordinary potential.<br>
        
        Youth Career <br>
        UD Las Palmas: Pedri moved to Las Palmas' youth academy at the age of 16. His performances in the youth teams quickly caught the attention of scouts, and he was soon promoted to the senior team in the 2019-2020 season.<br>
