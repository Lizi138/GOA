        <h1 id="h1-3">What's Football?</h1>
        <h3 id="h3-5">Football, also called association football or soccer, is a game involving two teams of 11 players who try to maneuver the ball 
            into the other team’s goal without using their hands or arms. <br>
            The team that scores more goals wins.
            Football is the world’s most popular ball game in numbers of participants and spectators.</h3>

        <h1 id="h1-4">What is the origin of Football?</h1>
        <h3 id="h3-6">Modern football originated in Britain in the 19th century. <br>
            Though “folk football” had been played since medieval times with varying rules, the game began to be standardized when it was taken up as a winter game at public schools. <br>
            The Football Association, formed in 1863, codified the rules of the game and hosted the first cup competition between regional football clubs in Britain.</h3>

        <h1 id="h1-5">How famous is Football?</h1>
        <h3 id="h3-7">Football (Soccer in the United States) is by far the world's most popular sport, with 3.5 billion fans as of 2025. <br>
            As the name suggests, football is a team sport wherein people use their feet to kick a ball, with the aim of getting the ball into the opposing net.</h3>

        <h1 id="h1-6">Football Without FANS</h1>
        <h3 id="h3-7">Football would be nothing without fans. When the Covid-19 lockdown struck and stadiums suddenly became empty, the need for packed-out grounds and 
            passionate supporters <br> became clearer than ever, and when English fans 
            of the so-called Big Six hit the streets to protest against the proposed plans for <br>
            a European Super League in 2021, the power of these supporters was reinforced emphatically. <br>
            Moments like this were all about fans being brought together, whether they were lifelong matchgoing fanatics and home and <br> away season ticket holders, 
            or younger audiences more used to TV broadcasts, who had developed <br>
            a slightly different relationship with their club. Technological developments and the ever-changing nature <br> of modern football means that these days, there are a number 
            of ways to support a team; in recent years, this has become 
            abundantly clear in the level of support certain teams receive <br>
            from soccer lovers in every corner of the world.</h3>

            football, game in which two teams of 11 players, using any part of their bodies except <br> their hands and arms, try to maneuver the ball into the opposing

            permitted to handle the ball and may do so only <br>
            within the penalty area surrounding the goal. The team that scores more goals wins.</h3>
