        Toni Kroos was born in the small city of Greifswald, in the northeastern part of Germany, where he developed his passion for football at a young age. His family was deeply involved in sports, with his father, Roland Kroos, a former footballer and coach, and his younger brother, Felix Kroos, also a professional footballer. Kroos began playing football at the Greifswalder SV before joining Hansa Rostock’s youth academy, where his talent was quickly recognized.<br>
        
        Early Career and Move to Bayern Munich<br>
        Youth Career: Kroos joined the youth academy of Hansa Rostock at the age of 10, and his exceptional talent soon saw him make the move to Bayern Munich's youth system in 2006, at the age of 16. Bayern Munich had been scouting him for years, and they saw immense potential in him, offering him a chance to continue his development at one of Europe’s biggest clubs.<br>
        
        Bayern Munich (2007-2009): Kroos made his professional debut for Bayern Munich in the 2007-2008 season at just 18 years old. However, given his age and the stiff competition for a first-team spot, he was loaned out to Bayer Leverkusen for the 2009-2010 season to gain valuable experience in the Bundesliga. During this loan spell, Kroos developed into one of the league’s most talented midfielders, showcasing his passing range, vision, and ability to control the tempo of a match.<br>
        
        Breakthrough at Bayern Munich<br>
        Return to Bayern (2010-2014): After a successful loan spell, Kroos returned to Bayern Munich for the 2010-2011 season, where he quickly became a mainstay in the midfield. Under then-manager Louis van Gaal, Kroos flourished and became known for his technical mastery, ability to dictate play, and precise passing. His long-range passes, free-kicks, and vision helped him make an immediate impact.<br>
        
        Kroos was a key part of Bayern’s successes during this period, including winning the Bundesliga and DFB-Pokal titles in 2013. He played a pivotal role in Bayern Munich’s historic 2013 UEFA Champions League victory, with his performances in the midfield becoming a defining feature of the team.<br>
        
        Real Madrid Move and Success (2014-Present)<br>
        Transfer to Real Madrid (2014): In 2014, after winning numerous domestic trophies with Bayern Munich, Kroos made a high-profile move to Real Madrid for a transfer fee of around €25 million—a relatively modest fee for a player of his quality. His arrival at Madrid coincided with a period of change and rebuilding under coach Carlo Ancelotti.<br>
        
        Immediate Impact at Real Madrid: In his first season at Madrid, Kroos quickly established himself as one of the best midfielders in the world. His deep-lying playmaker role, often sitting just in front of the defense, allowed him to dictate the rhythm of the game with exceptional passing and movement. He was integral to Real Madrid’s 2014 UEFA Champions League victory, helping the club secure its La Décima (tenth European Cup/Champions League title) under Ancelotti.<br>
        
        Success Under Various Managers (2014-Present): Over the years, Kroos has continued to be a central figure at Real Madrid, contributing to multiple Champions League titles, La Liga championships, and Copa del Rey victories. He was a key part of Madrid’s dominance in European football during the 2010s, with the club winning four Champions League titles in five years (2014, 2016, 2017, 2018).<br>

        International Career<br>
        Germany National Team (2010-Present): Kroos made his international debut for Germany in 2010 and has since become one of the pillars of the national team. He was an integral part of Germany’s 2014 FIFA World Cup winning team.
